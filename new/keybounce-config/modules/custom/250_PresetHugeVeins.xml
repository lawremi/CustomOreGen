                Very large, extremely rare motherlodes.  Each motherlode has many long slender branches - so thin that
                parts of the branch won't contain any ore at all.  This, combined with the incredible length of the
                branches, makes them more challenging to follow underground.  Once found, however, a motherlode contains
                enough ore to keep a player supplied for a very long time.
                The rarity of these veins might be too frustrating in a single-player setting.  In SMP, though, teamwork 
                could make finding them much easier and the motherlodes are big enough to supply several people without
                shortage.  This might be a good way to add challenge to multiplayer worlds.
