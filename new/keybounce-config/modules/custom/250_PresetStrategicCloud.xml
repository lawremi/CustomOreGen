            <Description>
                Large irregular clouds filled lightly with ore.  These are huge, spanning several 
                adjacent chunks, and consequently rather rare.  They contain a sizeable amount of
                ore, but it takes some time and effort to mine due to low density.
                The intent for strategic clouds is that the player will need to actively search for
                one and then set up a semi-permanent mining base and spend some time actually mining
                the ore.
