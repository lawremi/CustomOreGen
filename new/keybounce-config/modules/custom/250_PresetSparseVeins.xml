            <Description>
                Large veins filled very lightly with ore.  Because they contain less ore per volume, 
                these veins are relatively wide and long.  Mining the ore from them is time consuming 
                compared to solid ore veins.  They are also more difficult to follow, since it is 
                harder to get an idea of their direction while mining.
