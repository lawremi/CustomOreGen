<!--************************  CustomOreGen Minecraft Ores Module *********************************

    <!--***************************   Options + Symbols   ***********************************
    *
    *   Below are options and symbols for Coal, Iron, Gold, Redstone, Diamond, Lapis Lazuli, 
    *   and Emerald.  Each ore has a "type" option corresponding to select which distribution
    *   is used for that ore in the overworld, and 3 mystcraft symbols for selecting 
    *   distributions in mystcraft ages.
    *
    *   Each ore also has its own overall "frequency" and "size" multipliers.  These are 
    *   provided so people can tweak the rarity of each ore from the options file rather 
    *   than having to edit the config directly.
    *

    <!--*****************************   Distributions   *************************************
    *   
    *   Below are the actual distributions for the vanilla ores in the overworld and 
    *   mystcraft ages.  There are currently 3 types of distribution for each ore:
    *     Layered Veins:  
    *       Some form of veins or clusters arranged loosely by height and more common 
    *       in affiliated biomes.
    *     Strategic Clouds:  
    *       Huge, rare, low-density clouds.  Size and frequency are fairly consistent; 
    *       density is varied to reflect ore rarity.  May be surrounded by a scattering 
    *       of single blocks as hints to help guide players in.
    *     Vanilla Clusters:
    *       A re-creation of the vanilla ore generation using the StandardGen algorithm.
